+ Path
  |_ Fix rename/mv
  |_ Full README with more real-world examples (grep scripts/)
     - compare folders using Path#ls_r and Path#md5
  |_ Documentation: categorize methods for large classes (the way Pathname does)
  |_ Organize into a class hierarchy (Path, FilePath, URLPath, RelativePath)
  |_ (Un)Archivers (zip, rar, etc.)

+ Logger
  |_ colourized ("ramaze" has a nice style)
  |_ output to STDERR (default)
  |_ no setup (default)
     |_ Log "message"      <- defaults to info
     |_ Log.warn "message"
     |_ Log object         <- prettyprints it
  |_ Verbose mode shows the calling method's info
     |_ eg: [file:line:method]
  |_ "gsmartcontrol" has good warning messages
      ie: "|13<warn>  |07[hz] Warning: exit: The device error log contains records of errors."
